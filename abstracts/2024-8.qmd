I have written this on-line multimedia textbook at the request of the Department of Archaeology, Sichuan University. It is far from complete, but after ten years I believe it is as complete as I am able to make it. The most significant lack is a discussion of slag. The Department is now translating the textbook into Chinese. Though the emphasis is naturally on the Chinese scene, I believe it will be useful to European students as well. At the conference I will introduce the textbook, show some samples of the contents, and ask for corrections and suggestions. The address is: https://donwagner.dk/arch-iron.
