### Call for Papers
The Research in Progress Meeting 2023 of the [Historical Metallurgy Society](https://historicalmetallurgy.org/){target="_blank"} will take place online on Saturday, 22^nd^ of April. It provides a forum for everyone working on topics related to ancient and historical metallurgical practices, the past use of metal objects, and related fields. We are keen to learn more about your ongoing or recently finished projects! The meeting aims to foster links between the different disciplines and geographical regions. Therefore, we particularly encourage submissions from early career researchers, contract archaeologists/conservators, and colleagues from outside Europe. There will be an HMS prize for the best student presentation. 

Abstracts (up to 200 words) can be submitted until March, 31^st^ via the [submission form](https://forms.gle/PJDpChyRJ7p7TKPk7){target="_blank"}. Please note that there won't be extensions of the submission deadline. Presentations can be either 6 min or 15 min long (with time for questions added). We encourage all presenters to take full advantage of the flexibility a virtual event provides and present their project in a way that suits them and their project best. Pre-recorded contribution are possible but the presenter must be present in the meeting to answer any questions. Presentations will be scheduled in a way that considers the different presenter’s time zones. 

Participation is free of charge. Please register for the event until April, 20 using the [registration form](https://forms.gle/oZnQKKX5VM6Vj1aN8){target="_blank"}. The link to the meeting room will be displayed once you successfully registered.  

The programme and any updates will be announced here and circulated by mail. General enquiries can be directed to Thomas Rose (<t.rose@em.uni-frankfurt.de>).

We are looking forward to seeing you in April!
