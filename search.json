It provides a forum for everyone working on topics related to ancient and historical metallurgical practices, the past use of metal objects, and related fields. We are keen to learn more about your ongoing or recently finished projects! The meeting aims to foster links between the different disciplines and geographical regions. Therefore, we particularly encourage submissions from early career researchers, contract archaeologists/conservators, and colleagues from outside Europe. There will be an HMS prize for the best student presentation.\nAbstracts (up to 200 words) can be submitted until 1st of October via the submission form. Please note that there won’t be extensions of the submission deadline. Presentations can be either 6 min or 15 min long (with time for questions added).
