    "title": "Weapons, Rituals, and the Making of a Warrior Society? A Use-Wear Assessment of Swords and Associated Artefacts with Weapon Function and Social Identity of Sinauli",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The recent excavations at Sinauli, Uttar Pradesh, have provided significant insights into the cultural and technological development of the late Protohistoric period in the Indian subcontinent. Among the most remarkable discoveries are the copper-decorated chariots and an assemblage of copper weapons found alongside Ocher Coloured Pottery (OCP). These finds invite renewed attention to the long-debated Copper Hoard tradition, whose artefacts are often discovered as isolated chance finds with little contextual information. This study analyses the material culture of Sinauli through a detailed examination of weapon morphology and surface wear patterns, supported by preliminary metallurgical and elemental observations. By exploring the physical traces of use and the contextual associations of these artefacts, the research aims to better understand their technological sophistication and potential social meanings. The work also considers the broader implications of such evidence for interpreting martial identities, ritual practices, and social organisation within early metal-using communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Standing at 1.2 metres tall and 0.8 metres wide, analysis of the constructional detail of the anchor reveals a composite object of complex fabrication, built from no fewer than 60 separate parts. Furthermore, a laminate construction suggests a sophisticated understanding of the mechanical properties and limitations of the available ferrous materials of the period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "The first insight into the origins of Ammonite iron through Os isotope analyses of iron arrowheads from the Late Iron Age cemetery of Tell El Mazar, Jordan",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Located on the eastern edge of the Jordan River Valley, the Tell El Mazar cemetery dates to the 6th–5th centuries BCE. During this time, despite the growing influence of Babylonian and Persian powers in the region, the Kingdom of Ammon retained a degree of autonomy. The research focuses on the provenance of 12 iron arrowheads from Tell El Mazar. Although the artefacts are heavily corroded, they are suitable for provenance investigation through Os isotope analysis, as osmium remains immobile during corrosion. The results reveal a diverse range of Os isotope ratios (187Os/188Os) across the assemblage, which can be classified into five distinct groups. These findings are further supported by siderophile trace element analyses performed by ICP-MS, indicating the use of multiple ore sources for the production of these weapons. Interestingly, none of the objects are consistent with ores from the Mugharet el-Wardeh, a major ore mine situated just 10 km from Tell El Mazar. Notably, two arrowheads exhibit highly radiogenic isotope compositions (5.255-6.124), which align with the isotope characteristics of copper production waste from the Faynan. This allows to raise new questions about the factors, which contributed to the adoption of iron metallurgy in the Levant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Rijksmuseum Boerhaave’s collection of scientific instruments contains around 60 Leyden jars. These objects are common to scientific instrument collections across the world and are notorious for developing problems with their metal foil layers, often leading to total loss of external foil. A collaborative research project between the University of Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Boerhaave, and the Dutch Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE), aimed to investigate and develop a treatment strategy for this problem.\nThree representative Leyden jars were selected as case study objects, and loose foil flakes were collected from a total of 11 separate Leyden jars in the Boerhaave’s collection. Using UV irradiation, SEM-EDX, micro-XRF, and FTIR, the metals foils, original adhesives used to adhere the foils and remnants of past consolidation treatments were analysed, providing better understanding of the jars’ production, history, and the degradation processes taking place. The results from these analyses were then used to develop a suitable treatment protocol for the fragile foil layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "First insights into the origin of iron in eastern Cilicia during the Iron Age, using osmium isotope and trace element analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The study focuses on the provenance investigation of several iron smithing slag and iron ores samples from the Iron Age phases (c. 750–575 BC) at Kinet Höyük, a major trading port on the coast of eastern Cilicia (Turkiye). Additionally, we analyse 18 ore samples from major iron deposits in the eastern Taurus region. The applied techniques include optical microscopy, XRD, XRF, analyses of siderophile and chalcophile elements by (ICP-MS), and Os-Re isotopy. The results allow the exclusion of the analysed iron ore samples from central Anatolia as a source of the iron processed at Kinet Höyük. The archaeological samples of slags and one of the archaeological ore samples fragments are characterised by low radiogenic 187Os/188Os ratios, high Os concentrations (411–15057 pg/g), elevated contents of Ni, Cr, As, and low contents of Co, V, Sb, and W. This suggests a local origin for the forged iron, the source of which should be sought in a geological environment associated with ultrabasic rocks in the ophiolitic suture zones. From the methodological perspective, the results allow stressing the usefulness of investigation of iron smithing remains by osmium isotopes for drawing connections blacksmithing and iron smelting workshops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

My current research aims to incorporate the scientific data obtained from studying Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age axes and halberds using metallography and Neutron analysis into a theoretical craft-focused perspective. Reflexive experimental bronze smithing will be used to try and replicate data from artefacts, and thereby reproduce a non-scientific, inductive chaine operatoire based on sense experience.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Architectural wrought irons from the 14th (Salisbury Cathedral), 18th (Blenheim Palace), and 21st (Topp & Co.) centuries are subject to optical, chemical, and mechanical characterisation. To investigate micro-mechanical failure mechanisms, tensile testing is undertaken in tandem to acoustic emission (AE) monitoring and digital image correlation measurements. The modern specimen exhibited expected ductile failure, with post-yield behaviour characterised by plastic deformations and uniform strain distributions. In contrast, the archaeological irons exhibited a defect-driven failure, evidenced by the emergence of multiple surface cracks, often on one face of the sample, and a high number of post-yield AE hits. Multivariate analysis and clustering of the AE signals using principal component analysis and DBSCAN identified three major failure mechanisms, differentiated by the signal’s peak frequency. These are the plastic deformation of iron, debonding between iron and slag and within different phases and microstructures of the iron matrix, and inclusion cracking. The latter two were supported by observations from fractography. A small number of high frequency events are identified and provisionally attributed to iron matrix cracking. This research ultimately provides deeper insight into the micro-mechanical failure mechanisms in wrought irons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "British Gunfounding after the Weald",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Until the 1750s, almost all cannon made in Britian were cast from charcoal blast furnaces in the Weald in southeast England. During the Seven Years’ War and after, coke blast furnaces began to be used, but guns made by the Carron Company in Scotland were so prone to bursting that they were withdrawn from service. In 1774, Anthony Bacon on behalf of John Wilkinson proposed casting cannon solid and boring them, rather than casting them with a core. Tests found that cannon cast solid were better, so that the Ordnance Board ordered all cannon to be cast solid. Wealden ironmasters were apparently unwilling to invest in the boring mills needed for this, so that Wealden gunfounding largely ceased. After the War of American Independence, Samuel Walker & Co of Rotherham became the Board’s sole supplier, in part recycling old cannon. They were joined in the 1790s by other suppliers, including the Carron Company, Clyde Ironworks, and Alexander Brodie of Calcutts in Shropshire. However, Gordon and Stanley, probably representing John Wilkinson’s Bradley Works had many guns failing proof and gave the business up. Unfortunately, after 1797 the surviving records are less penetrable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "John Baskerville (1707-75), England’s foremost printer, was the designer of the famous Baskerville typeface. His designs for roman and italic, upper- and lower-case, and numbers and symbols, were cut into small iron bars (punches) of various sizes which were then used to produce the types for the printing press. &gt;3,000 Baskerville punches have survived until today, representing one of the most complete collections. However, very little is known about punch-making, nowadays a practically lost skill at the core of printing technology, cross-cutting black smithing, engraving and other crafts.\nAs part of the AHRC-funded project “Small Performances”, and with the aim of reverse-engineering punch-making technology, we developed an ad hoc calibration to conduct surface pXRF analyses on &gt;300 punches. These analyses served to identify distinct compositional groups that correlate with typological, macroscopic features. The groups were cross-referenced with observations under the optical microscope to understand letter cut techniques. As a result, we propose a series of hypothesis on how different metal batches interlinked with individual ways of forging and cutting these iron bars. This will ultimately allow us to better understand this technology, as well as the organisation of the workshop where these punches were manufactured in 18th century Birmingham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study revolves around understanding the ancient metallurgy of Panchadhathu (five metal alloy)/ ashtadhathu (eight metal alloy) alloy making which was prevalent in ancient India, especially in its southern counterparts. This work is trying to locate these technological achievements as a prototype of modern High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) by examining the metallurgical practices, cultural contexts and technological sophistication. Even before formal codification of metallurgical practices, ancient blacksmiths showcased remarkable progress in this field and especially they understood core alloying principles like entropy stabilization, corrosion resistance, and mechanical strength. Preliminary studies show the importance of multi-component alloys in Ancient India and its potential to offer insights in to resource optimization and sustainable practices as well. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional metallurgical knowledge system with modern sustainable engineering practices through an interdisciplinary approach where archaeology, materials science and heritage studies are intertwined. Through experimenting with different compositions and combinations, this study aims to integrate past understanding of the technique of alloying with the contemporary advanced technologies thereby creating a sustainable and futuristic methodology for the production and utilization of metals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Wrought iron assemblages from Blenheim Palace (18th century) and Topp & Co (modern re-rolled) were subject to optical, chemical, and mechanical analysis to determine their properties. Samples were prepared using standard metallographic techniques and investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Vicker’s hardness testing, and tensile testing. A MATLAB code was developed to automatically segment and quantify grain and slag inclusion sizes from micrographs. Chemical properties of samples, processed using principal component analysis, highlighted that the iron and slag components have broadly similar chemical compositions. Differences arise due to different manufacturing techniques used in historic (indirect method with charcoal) and modern (indirect method with coal) samples. More importantly, image analysis revealed that both sets of samples feature similar sized slag inclusions and ferrite grains. The Topp & Co assemblage had greater mechanical properties when compared to the Blenheim Palace samples, although this is again explained by manufacturing methods. Based on this analysis, it is judged that the modern Topp & Co wrought iron can sufficiently capture the chemistry and microstructural characteristics of historic 18th century wrought irons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Corrosion of archaeological metals may be complex owing to the varying influences of the burial environments, alloy compositions, and microstructures, and internal (residual) and external (burial) stresses imposed on artifacts. This book surveys the corrosion-related metallurgy and long-term corrosion of archaeological copper alloy artifacts excavated from aerobic soil environments in Iran, and also the remedial and restoration issues, including conservation, as contributions to the cultural heritage of Iran. The final step is cultural heritage management (CHM), whose main objectives are the classification and understanding of deterioration risks, i.e., further corrosion, and avoiding them. The risks include excavation and displacement from the original burial sites and insufficiently controlled display and storage environments. In addition, the book discusses the scientific methods employed in corrosion assessment and diagnosis, such as metallography, surface analysis, and corrosion product characterization. The interdisciplinary approach adopted offers insights valuable not only for archaeologists but also for conservation scientists and materials engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "There has been a great deal of work done on the characterisation of malleable irons made by the direct, bloomery, process, much less on indirect iron generally and even less on the indirect iron specifically used in Britain between 1500 and 1900.\nFive processes were used to produce such iron. Classical charcoal hearths came in two variants, known in the 18th Century as the French (or Walloon) method, and the German. The difference was that some form of iron oxide was added in the latter when the pig iron feedstock contained higher silicon levels.\nThen there were the coal/coke fired processes, firstly potting and stamping, where the pig was treated before the main process to remove silicon, then dry puddling, with an identical pre-treatment, and wet puddling, where iron oxide additions formed a part of the bath.\nThe proposition is that all these processes left characteristic clues in the body of the iron, including the amount and chemical nature of the included slag and in the overall bulk composition.\nThe author is a research student at the University of Warwick where he has at his disposal (in the Advanced Materials laboratory!) a very impressive array of analytical equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "Since prehistoric times, the Greek Laurion region supplied the Aegean and particularly the Athenians with silver. Around 500 BC, the yield of the mines was considerably expanded, allowing the city-state of Athens to build a new fleet, thus defeating the Persians in 480 BC. This has been linked to the discovery of a deeper, subsurface mineralization, the so-called ‘Third Contact’. Through my Marie Skłodowska Curie Postdoc project at the National Centre for Scientific Research “Demokritos” at Athens I will explore the feasibility of examining any age and geochemical disparities in the different mineralizations at Laurion. This will be achieved by studying ore-samples using mineralogical, chemical as well as lead-isotope analyses, the latter to be conducted at the German Mining Museum. Additionally, the project seeks to correlate ores from distinct contacts with archaeological artefacts crafted from Laurion ores (silver coins, lead, also litharges, slags etc) exhibiting the same lead isotopic signatures. This will make the chronological sequence of mining in the various mineralizations comprehensible, namely the begin of the exploitation of the ‘Third Contact’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The end of the Middle Ages (13th-15th centuries) was a period of profound political, demographic and economic changes in France. In this context, copper and its alloys were available to all social classes in Europe from the 13th century onwards. However, our knowledge of the production and circulation of copper during this period remains limited. A number of mines in the French Pyrenees that may have contributed to copper production at the end of the Middle Ages have already been identified. Compositional analyses (ICP-MS with laser ablation) have been carried out on selections of archaeological objects dating from this period and found in the area where Pyrenean productions were most widespread. These analyses have made it possible to determine the nature of the alloys and to identify potential minor and trace elements that indicate the use of particular ores or enable metal stocks to be traced. This study will enable to investigate the filiation between ores and objects, in order to study changes in circulation areas and supply circuits for copper alloy products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This topic based on the proposed study will examine the perceptions and treatment of people with disability and other marginalized populations within archaeometallurgical societies in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. The primary objective is to understand how societal attitudes towards disability influenced participation in iron working activities, a crucial aspect of these communities’ economic and cultural life. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research will combine archaeological evidence, ethnographic interviews, and historical accounts to investigate the social dynamics surrounding disability in the context of ironworking rituals. Preliminary archaeological findings indicate that marginalized groups often faced systemic exclusion due to prevailing taboos, reflecting broader societal attitudes. However, some archaeological evidence suggests that individuals with disabilities were integrated into specific community roles, challenging narratives of total exclusion. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to contemporary discussions on inclusivity and representation in archaeological narratives. By highlighting the complexities of social inclusion and identity within these ancient societies, this study will advocate for a more nuanced understanding of how perceptions of disability shaped technological practices and social dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Pre- and Protohistory, the selection and use of technical ceramics were mandatory for the success of all pyrometallurgical processes connected with iron and were therefore not arbitrary. Drawing on selected Medieval case from the southern Czech Republic covering different production contexts (rural and proto-urban), we show that interdisciplinary analyses (macroscopic, pXRF, ED-XRF, XRD, SEM-EDS) of ceramic debris such as tuyeres, furnace parts, and hearth fragments in relation with associated pyrometallurgical features and slags yield crucial insights into workshop organization and resource-distribution networks. In doing so, we address the entire metallurgical chain, from iron smelting to subsequent processing of iron (blacksmithing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Iron production has a long tradition in the area, spanning from the Middle Ages up until the 19th century, during which it was the main Bohemian ironworking region. The contribution summarises the current results of a landscape archaeology oriented research of the northwestern part of Brdy region. Using common methods of non-destructive archaeology, such as LiDAR data prospection, a great number of ironworking-related sites were identified. These include a great number of charcoal-burning platforms and mining sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The production of bronzes in early medieval Tamil Nadu was linked with political and religious developments. The images were produced in large number from the 8th to the 18th century, principally in the Thanjavur and Tiruchchirappalli districts of modern Tamil Nadu and maintained a high standard of excellence for almost 1,000 years. The bronze images of South India are classified into three sections: “Chala” that is moveable, which are in bronze and are easily portable; utsava beras, or procession deities; Achala (immoveable), in stone, large and heavy. In this paper, the researcher will explore the fascinating world of miniature Chala (movable) bronzes from the 17th to 18th centuries AD. The study aims to delve into the complexities of Silpasastra, the traditional art of sculpture-making, to uncover the techniques and processes involved in crafting these exquisite bronze sculptures. By examining historical context, artistic methods, and cultural significance, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the craftsmanship and heritage embedded in these remarkable artifact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

We invite the community to participate in identifying the words and structures that we need to include and to take part in the research needed to develop the entries in both. At present we are at the design stage and invite participation here too. Examples of typical entries will be given for discussion (for example the whole family of tin alloys used in the past). The atlas is being developed in collaboration with the Archaeometallurgy Committee of ASM International and the format of the pages will match that of their own online atlas of structures, but we invite members to add their own micrographs and take part in the design and editing. We believe the results of these two collaborative projects will be a rich source of knowledge into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Not only do they possess a certain romantic flair, as prominent markers of social status, they are an opulent display of the techniques available at a given place and time when funding is no object. Swords have typically taken centre stage of both public fancy and academic study, which has sometimes eclipsed interest in other weapons. To wit, seaxes, the characteristic single edged blades found across Early Medieval Western and Central Europe. A scant few from the continent have undergone metallurgical analysis but wide scale studies, comparing typology, chaîne opératoire and provenance have yet to be undertaken. The Acies Ferri PhD is one such study, focusing on 5th-9th weapons between the Seine and Rhine Rivers. The project currently has access to seven swords and thirty-two seaxes, found across the Alsace region of Eastern France. The present paper aims to cover the progress of the PhD project with particular focus on two aspects of the creation of seaxes in Merovingian Alsace: what links, if any, exist between chronology, typology and sword construction? Where did the iron used for these swords come from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The study presents a detailed analysis of two silver punch-marked coins from recently discovered early historic site Tekttha, Naogaon, Bangladesh. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, this study attempts to provide a thorough understanding of the surface enrichment and deterioration patterns of these coins. Numerous compounds are found in the investigation, including tenorite (CuO), copper oxide (CuO), silver (Ag), copper zinc (CuZn), and zincite (ZnO).\nThe XRD analysis highlights the long-term effects of chemical and environmental interactions, revealing a sophisticated understanding of the surface composition. The presence of zincite indicates complex metallurgical processes, while the detection of copper compounds and their oxides suggests significant corrosion processes. With their insights into the mechanisms of degradation affecting these artifacts, these findings are crucial for conservation efforts.\nThis study provides insights into the metallurgical practices and post-depositional alterations of ancient coinage within a region. These results contribute to a broader understanding of the culture and economy of ancient Tekttha, revealing technological capacities and substance dynamics in antiquity. The use of XRD in this context highlights its effective-ness for archaeological science, encouraging non-invasive research that preserves the integrity of artifacts while unveiling their historical narratives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project focuses on the fabrication techniques of one-piece helmets in Europe between the 12th and 15th centuries. The common assumption is that these would be formed from iron and steel sheet using a process called angle raising, which involves hammering from the outside over a stake anvil. However, modern reproductions made in this way deviate significantly from the originals in both interior texture and, most critically, thickness distribution. Our proposed technique, known as stretch raising, produces much closer results by starting from thick plate and working from the inside against a flat anvil. The implicit advantage from a medieval perspective is that this technique can be applied directly to a refined bloom without the need for an intermediate step of sheet metal production. We compare our results against interior textures and thickness data collected from extant examples. We also draw on contemporary artistic depictions and written records, as well as later evidence of comparable techniques from the early modern period, up to the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the Victorian ‘Age of Metallurgy’, more metals were ‘discovered’ than in any era before. With the influx of these new materials along with metal-based technological developments of the First and Second Industrial Revolutions, metallurgy became a key science and practice in British industrial imperialism. Metal-dependent industries, such as transportation, arms, and communications boomed as the British Empire expanded over the globe’s surface and subsurface, increasing extraction and production of more metal-based technologies that would optimize further exploitation of colonised land and labour.\nIn his 1886 President’s address to the Iron and Steel Institute, metallurgist John Percy proclaimed that “the history of the metallurgic arts is involved in the history of the civilisation of man”. Using this quote and Percy’s seminal text Metallurgy: Iron and Steel (1864) as a point of departure, I will be investigating Percy’s work on coal, iron, and civilisation and its material consequences in the context of British industrial imperialism. This work in progress investigates the interweaving of racialised ethnological beliefs about civilisation with the creation of metallurgical knowledge as applied to late 19th century British hierarchies of iron smelting technologies with a particular focus on India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Paths of Production: Spatial and Experimental Investigations of Native Copper Working In North America’s Native Copper Industry",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This presentation explores native copper production in North America’s Native Copper Industry, with a focus on the Archaic period (ca. 6000–1000 BCE) and the copper-rich region of Isle Royale. Drawing on both archaeological evidence and experimental archaeology, the research aims to reconstruct stages of copper production—from raw material acquisition to artifact manufacture. Fieldwork includes analysis of copper artifacts, hammerstones, and production debris from multiple Archaic sites at varying distances from copper lodes. These data are compared to results from experimental replication of traditional cold-hammering, annealing, and shaping techniques using native copper sourced from the region. Patterns observed suggest a spatial relationship between site function and proximity to copper sources, indicating that copper was often worked near its source, with finished or partially finished tools transported to distant habitation sites. This integrated approach provides new insights into the organization of early metallurgical practices in the Great Lakes region and enhances understanding of the social and technological complexity of pre-contact Indigenous copper use. The findings also contribute to broader discussions of early metalworking in Hunter-Gather societies and demonstrate the value of combining experimental archaeology with regional artifact analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "Archaeometallurigical investigations on the sites of Tigray with the evidences of iron slags made possible in reconstructing evidence of iron smelting societies. The central aim of this paper is to explore and locate the ancient metallurgical sites and to synthesize the tradition of iron smelting in the region. It is a recent phenomenon and iron smelting in Tigray is currently unrecognizable but, to profuse the tradition of the past community locating the distribution of the evidence of slag sites is the primary task. Thus, ethno historic interviews, field survey and oral traditions were used to interpret the data qualitatively in a descriptive way. Survey and preliminary geological investigation indicates that the ores in the nearby areas of the sites may have been the sources for ancient iron productions. Preliminary analysis of potsherds and radiocarbon dating (in some sites) indicated that the sites were possibly settlement sites. The region particularly Eastern part of Tigray has significant metallurgical sites history which is supported by the presence of many rock hewn churches which could indicate the beginning of iron ore production was mainly during the Aksumite times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the 2nd millennium BC, the Eurasian Steppe witnessed profound transformations in metal production and circulation, reflecting the rise of socio-economic networks and technological specialisation among semi-pastoralist communities. While the movement of copper alloys and finished artefacts across this region is well documented, growing attention is now directed towards the choices underpinning primary production and the organisation of metallurgical practices.\nWe present new data from key metalmaking contexts spanning the Late to Final Bronze Age in Central and East Kazakhstan. Each site offers distinct perspectives on metallurgical traditions and production modes, highlighting both shared technologies and regional variation in smelting recipes and alloying strategies. Communities of metalsmiths processed similar ores but developed different approaches shaped by local resources, cultural preferences, and shifting exchange networks.\nArchaeometallurgical analyses of ores, slags, and technical ceramics reveal how knowledge was created, adapted, and transmitted across the Eurasian Steppe, underscoring it as a dynamic arena of innovation during the Bronze Age.\nThe ERC DREAM aims to advance the current understanding of metalmaking technology in the Eurasian Steppe, and to situate the region as a central hub of technological and social transformation during the Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bồng Miêu gold mine in Quảng Nam province, central Vietnam, provides a rare case study of the long-term history of gold exploitation in mainland Southeast Asia. Archaeological and historical evidence suggest that extraction began during the Protohistoric period through alluvial panning, later expanding to small-scale underground mining. These practices likely continued under the kingdom of Champā and the Empire of Annam, highlighting the enduring economic and political significance of gold in the region. In the late 19th century, Bồng Miêu became the first modern gold mine in French Indochina. Established in 1896, it incorporated advanced infrastructure, including an aerial cable system, and cyanidation processing facilities. Between 1900 and 1918, over 250,000 tons of ore were extracted, yielding more than one ton of gold, though recovery rates remained limited. A major modernization program in the early 1930s improved recovery efficiency from 60% to 90%, with peak annual production reaching 258kg in 1935. This paper examines how the Bồng Miêu gold mine reflects the evolution and local adaptation of mining and metallurgical practices in a colonial context, marked by a long sequence of occupation and a shift from local exploitation to industrial activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The iron cannonry of medieval Bengal marked a transformative phase in regional military and technological history. With some specific examples of iron cannon, this paper offers a technological overview of iron cannonry within broader contexts of metallurgy, warfare, and regional innovation. Cannons such as the Jahankosha of Murshidabad, the Bachhawali of Hazarduari, and Dal Mardan of Bishnupur illustrate the mastery of forge-welding techniques. These cannons were made by hammering and welding multiple iron blooms and reinforced with concentric rings to create massive yet resilient artillery pieces. Archaeometric examination of the Dal Mardan through SEM and XRD has brought to light slag inclusions, fayalite phases, and traces of high phosphorus. These features point towards a direct-reduction process of sponge iron and, at the same time, explain the cannon’s unusual resistance to corrosion. Other examples, like the Kale Khan/Kale Jamjam and the Bibi Mariam of Dhaka, attributed to the famed Janardan Karmakar under Mughal patronage, demonstrate the ability of Bengal’s workshops to produce artillery on an extraordinary scale. However, the comparatively smaller-sized, forge-welded guns now displayed in the Tripura State Museum offer a different perspective tailored for mobility and riverine warfare, reflecting local needs and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The SS Great Britain, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the largest ship afloat when launched in 1843, is Bristol’s top-rated tourist attraction and makes a vital contribution to the UK’s cultural heritage. However, preserving the salt-water impregnated iron hull remains a challenge. To develop effective and sustainable conservation strategies, a corrosion baseline must be established against which to assess future changes. However, conventional methods for characterising corrosion, which typically involve transporting samples to a laboratory, are impractical for large heritage and often require sample destruction. Therefore, developing in-situ techniques for corrosion assessment is essential for the preservation of cultural heritage. Here, we propose using handheld X-Ray fluorescence (hXRF) as a new approach to characterise corrosion of large-scale heritage iron. The hXRF data offers a comprehensive elemental analysis of the SS Great Britain’s hull, enabling the identification of spatial variations in the corrosion extent. Furthermore, supporting laboratory measurements show that the corrosion layer comprises not only the anticipated iron (oxyhydr)oxides, but also a significant portion of carbonate and silicate minerals. Crucially, the presence of these impermeable phases may inhibit corrosion by acting as a passivation layer that impedes moisture and oxygen from reaching the metallic iron below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."
